1--> You are given a number n and find nth fibonacci

f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2);
this recurrence relaton has a problem.It actually repeats subproblem many times
this is also known as repeation of sub problem

so the solution is dynamic programming we have to memorise the smaller problem
solution

Identification of dp:-
1.repeating sub problem
2.Optimal substructure(If you can get answer of bigger problem then 
                        if are able to find ans of bigger problem)
3.most of cases you will get counting problems and also maximize and minimize
problem.
